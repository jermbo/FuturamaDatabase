#Futurama Database

Some place holder information for me to teach programming concepts to my students.

### Start the Local JSON Server

Navigate to your project folder and install the modules.

	npm install

Then start the json-server :
	
	npm start

(note "npm start" just does the following json-server --watch db.json)
